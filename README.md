# Eye Color

The eyes are said to be the windows to the soul, but did you know your genes are a window to your eyes? Eye color refers to the color of the iris, which can be blue, green, hazel, brown, or many shades in between.

## How this genome app works?

This Genome App calculates the probability of having a specific eye color using your DNA and the HIrisPlex system, a logistic regression model.

## Biology

Eye color is determined by variations in a personâ€™s genes. Most of the genes associated with eye color are involved in the production, transport, or storage of a pigment called melanin. Eye color is directly related to the amount and quality of melanin in the front layers of the iris. People with brown eyes have a large amount of melanin in the iris, while people with blue eyes have much less of this pigment.
